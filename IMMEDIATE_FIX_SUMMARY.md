## 🎯 **YOUR WORKING URLS RIGHT NOW**

While Platform.sh deployment propagates, **use these URLs that definitely work**:

### 📁 **"Job 3" folder (39 Instagram posts):**
```
https://main-bvxea6i-inhoolfrqniuu.eu-5.platformsh.site/organizations/1/projects/1/data-storage/job/104
```

### 📁 **"Job 2" folder (39 posts):**
```
https://main-bvxea6i-inhoolfrqniuu.eu-5.platformsh.site/organizations/1/projects/1/data-storage/job/103
```

### 📊 **API Endpoints (for direct data access):**
```
https://main-bvxea6i-inhoolfrqniuu.eu-5.platformsh.site/api/brightdata/job-results/104/
https://main-bvxea6i-inhoolfrqniuu.eu-5.platformsh.site/api/brightdata/job-results/103/
```

## 🚀 **FUTURE HUMAN-FRIENDLY URLS** 
*(Once Platform.sh deployment completes)*

### Frontend URLs:
```
https://main-bvxea6i-inhoolfrqniuu.eu-5.platformsh.site/organizations/1/projects/1/data-storage/Job%203/1
https://main-bvxea6i-inhoolfrqniuu.eu-5.platformsh.site/organizations/1/projects/1/data-storage/Job%202/1
```

### API URLs:
```
https://main-bvxea6i-inhoolfrqniuu.eu-5.platformsh.site/api/brightdata/data-storage/Job%203/1/
https://main-bvxea6i-inhoolfrqniuu.eu-5.platformsh.site/api/brightdata/data-storage/Job%202/1/
```

## 💡 **EXPLANATION OF /data-storage/run/271**

**Why that URL doesn't work:**
- Folder 271 **does not exist** in your database  
- Highest folder ID is only 105
- Your real data is in folders 103 and 104
- The frontend was showing a cached/phantom folder ID

**What happened to your new scrape job:**
- New scrapes are likely going to folder 105 ("nike" folder)
- Check folder 105 for your latest data
- The system is working, just different folder IDs than expected

---

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN**

1. **✅ FIXED: Server Error** - No more 500 errors
2. **🔄 WAITING: Platform.sh** - New endpoints deploying (5-10 min)  
3. **📋 USE NOW: Working URLs** - Access folders 103 and 104 immediately
4. **🚀 TEST LATER: Human-friendly URLs** - Try new format in 10 minutes
