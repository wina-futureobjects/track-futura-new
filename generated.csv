It wasn’t just an ordinary visit — it held deep meaning for us.
29 and 27 years ago, my wife’s parents left (passed away) her and her siblings at a young age.
Since then, it was abang who stepped up — carrying both roles — always there to guide, support, and protect them like his own.

Being able to welcome him and his family into our home this Raya brought a different kind of warmth.
Seeing the kids — the cucus — laughing, playing, and bonding so naturally made us feel as if Ayah and Ibu were with us too, smiling over the gathering.

Moments like these remind me — it’s not about how grand the house is or how lavish the spread.
It’s about the barakah in the hearts that fill the space.

Alhamdulillah for blessings that words sometimes cannot even describe."

我们本是自由的，
但一出生，标签便悄悄落在我们身上。

乖巧、听话、优秀、普通、失败者……
社会用这些词来衡量价值，
我们为了被认同，也学会了迎合，
活在标签之下，寻找自我价值的影子。

可内心深处，我们始终在抗拒。
因为那份对“自由做自己”的渴望，
从未真正消失。
只是，被生活一层一层盖住了。

直到某一刻，我们开始重新审视自己。
原来，这些标签并不是我们本来的模样。
我们可以选择撕掉它，
去活出那个自己真正想成为的样子。

我们也不再轻易为他人贴标签，
因为我们明白：
每个人都有属于自己的定义、自己的成功。
所谓的“道德”，有时只是用来束缚别人的工具。
尤其是对那些还在努力翻身的底层人。

真正的自由，不是任性妄为，
而是有意识地看清意义与价值，
自律成长，自我负责，自给自足。
然后，把力量留给自己，把善意留给别人。
这才是强者的思维，也是更高阶的自由

原视频来自记南烛。

We were born free,
but from the moment we entered this world, labels quietly found their way onto us.

“Obedient,” “clever,” “average,” “a failure”…
Society uses these labels to define worth,
and in our need for approval, we learned to conform —
seeking validation under the weight of expectations.

But deep inside, we’ve always been resisting.
The desire to truly be ourselves never disappeared — just buried under layers of life.

One day, we begin to see clearly:
these labels were never who we really were.
We can choose to peel them off,
and become who we were meant to be.

True freedom isn’t reckless.
It’s choosing with awareness, growing with discipline,
and living by values we define for ourselves.

That is strength — and a higher kind of freedom."

16 Years in the Business | 17 April 2025

I was just 21 when I RNF’d - wide-eyed, full of hope, with a simple dream: To make a real difference in people’s lives, especially the ones I loved.

I still remember what my leader’s mentor told me back then:
“If you do this right, with sincerity and service, you’ll never run out of people to help.”

Back then, I had no idea how deeply this journey would shape me. I just knew I wanted to be someone others could count on.

Fast forward 16 years…
440 clients. Countless moments of courage, care, and conversation.

Still here.
Still growing.
Still giving from the heart.

Grateful for every person who’s been part of this story -
Clients who became friends, friends who became clients, mentors who saw more in me than I saw in myself and my tribe who’ve stood by me through every season.

Here’s to the journey ahead.
The best is yet to come.

Met this young Indian lady recently—she’s got a degree in Computer Science but is feeling stuck at a crossroad, unsure of her next step. From a total stranger, I had the chance to journey with her using the Enneagram and coaching card. It opened her eyes to the areas she can grow in, and gave her a clearer sense of direction.

Honestly, it filled me with so much joy! Even though I’m not from her industry, I’m thankful I could contribute by helping her build clarity, confidence, and values to guide her decisions.

Also want to give a shoutout to my coach @lilianong73 who’s been such a strong support in my own growth. Through her 5-day challenge, I gained fresh perspective, strategy and direction in my recruitment efforts. She truly complements my weaknesses and gives me the push I need.

We even got to celebrate our birthdays together—and as her coachee, I had the privilege of using the coaching card @jensensiaw to bless her back with clarity and purpose in her current season.

So grateful for these divine appointments. Life is meaningful when we can pour what we’ve learned into others.

Grateful for the chance to explore, unwind, and celebrate some amazing wins with even more amazing people.
We laughed (a lot), ate till our bellies were filled and even got to celebrate 3 birthdays while we were there. Talk about perfect timing! 🎉🎂
Moments like these remind me why we do what we do. Not just for the goals, but for the growth, the memories, and the people we get to share them with.
Until the next one ✈️💼

Visited the Venice of the East, one of the best preserved ancient water towns in China. 

1. Got someone to write a poem based on the characters of my Chinese name. Incredible how he could compose one from scratch within 30 seconds. 

2. Tried out their business class high speed rail (Shanghai ➡️ 昆山) for $15. 

3-5. Some crew moments while touring the water areas. Even tipping is at another level. 扫一扫二维码就行了.

With our close-knit team, the planning sessions were focused and engaging with great conversations. Outside the meeting room, we soaked in the local culture— from exploring Talad Noi, the iconic Maeklong Railway Market, and the floating market, to making our first visit to the dreamy Bubble in the Forest Cafe.
We even tried out Muay Thai and learned to cook four classic Thai dishes in a fun, hands-on cooking class.
A perfect blend of culture, food, and fun! Here’s to a strong start to the year and more memories ahead!

Then came our version of The Amazing Race — putting our skills to the test: from street approaches to HNW simulations, product drills to diving deep into the ACC heritage.

Afternoon - All about sharpening the sword: objection handling, real talk, real practice. 

Wrapped it up with a bold commitment — kicking off the Iron Mind 100-day challenge.

But what unfolded was a humbling, heartwarming reminder of what truly matters in life. Here’s what I learnt:

𝗣𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀🎁✨
The biggest impact wasn’t from gifts, it was from the people who showed up. Being physically present, carving out time just to be there with me, was the most powerful form of love I could’ve received. That kind of effort stays with you.

𝗚𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗯𝗲𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗲𝗶𝘃𝗲 🤝
I’ve never really planned birthday surprises for my wife. But after being on the receiving end of such a thoughtful gesture, it clicked. This is how good it feels to be loved intentionally.
Now I find myself asking, “𝙒𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙄 𝙙𝙤 𝙩𝙤 𝙢𝙖𝙠𝙚 𝙝𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙖𝙮 𝙨𝙥𝙚𝙘𝙞𝙖𝙡 𝙩𝙤𝙤?” Because love isn’t just about feeling—it’s about giving.

𝗜𝘁’𝘀 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗼𝗼 𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴🌱
It took me 32 years to understand the power of gratitude.
To slow down, reflect, and truly appreciate the people around me. This birthday taught me to treat others how I want to be treated. Not just in big moments, but in the little ones too.

𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗴𝘂𝘆𝘀 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝗧𝗟𝗖🧡
I used to think I didn’t need the whole “tender loving care” thing.
But truth is… I’m human. And moments of real connection with friends, with loved ones matter. Friendship, camaraderie, and emotional support hit deeper than I expected. And I’m grateful.

Here’s to 32 for the growth, the love, and the unexpected lessons that showed up in the most beautiful way. 🙏"

This picture hits hard.
Sometimes, we think we know everything.
We walk into rooms with confidence...
But life has a way of humbling us.

What I’ve learned from the industry:
 ➡️ Years won’t matter.
 ➡️ You’ll always have room for growth.
 ➡️ You’ll always learn from every season.

In these moments, we’re reminded:
 → We don’t have all the answers.
 → We’re not always right.
 → And that’s okay.

Success isn’t defined by how long you’ve been in the game—it’s defined by your willingness to keep evolving.

The most successful people I know aren’t the ones who stop at “𝙠𝙣𝙤𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙚𝙣𝙤𝙪𝙜𝙝”—they’re the ones who stay humble, stay open, and keep learning.

Even with 20 years of experience, there’s always room to grow. 

Every season brings new lessons, new challenges, and new opportunities to improve.

Stay hungry. Stay humble. Stay teachable.

 Life will keep teaching—if you're willing to keep learning.

Dropped by GE Customer Service Centre today to help a client settle claims and handle policy admin.

This is the part of the job people don’t often see — no stage, no spotlight, just showing up where it matters.

One of the reasons I chose this path with Zeyn is the flexibility to be present — not just for work, but for people.

Because at the heart of it, financial planning isn’t just about numbers.
It’s about trust, service, and showing up.

Success isn’t just about talent, hustle, or even luck. It’s about the systems you build around your goals.

A good system gives you structure. It takes the guesswork out of your day. It keeps you consistent even when motivation fades.

Whether it’s your daily routine, your workflow, your fitness, or your client approach—build systems that support your long-term vision, not just your short-term wins.

The right system turns effort into results. It helps you grow, scale, and sustain success year after year.

Set goals, but build systems.
Because systems don’t rely on willpower—they rely on design."

This year, I made a spontaneous decision by booking a solo trip to Bali for my birthday. Behind the spontaneity was a quiet need for something more - more clarity, more courage, more connection with myself. The thought of being alone in an unfamiliar place can be intimidating. But there’s no one to distract me, from me. And in that silence, I started to listen. I listened more—to the world around me and to myself. I noticed the little things: the art that spoke to me, dogs chasing waves, the sound of the ocean crashing onto shore. I confronted thoughts and feelings I usually drowned out with busyness. I learnt to appreciate my own pace, my own rhythm. I celebrated myself for the first time and celebrated with strangers who I may never meet again. And in all of that, I found a deep fulfilling sense of freedom 🫶🏻"

Disclaimer: not trying to be disrespectful to anyone. Pardon the AI effect. 

“Sir, I just want to shake your hand.”
(He gave me a weird stare… and a gentle smack on the arm.)

After listening to the legendary Tony Gordon—the GOAT of the insurance industry—share his story, I was deeply inspired.

At 79, he flew from the US to Malaysia just to spend an hour with us. He could’ve stayed in the comfort of home, or travelled with friends. But he chose to be here—to give, to serve, to lift others. That alone taught me something: greatness doesn’t retire.

After his session, everyone rushed to take photos. I couldn’t get close, so I cheekily “photo bombed” and AI-ed myself closer in Photo 1.

But eventually, as the room cleared, we got a proper photo with him.

Then came my moment.
I walked up, extended my hand, and said:
“Sir, I just want to shake your hand.”

He looked at me with a confused stare… then gave me a light smack on the arm.

I wasn’t trying to be cheeky or disrespectful.
I just wanted to feel the warmth of his hand.
To remind myself—he’s human. Just like us.
Same warmth. Same heart. Same opportunity to do something great with our lives.

I’m grateful for this journey.
Grateful for the team and family we’ve built at PFG.
And grateful even for the tough days—because they’re shaping us for something greater.

Let’s keep going.
Because if he can, we can.
If he did, so can we.

✨ Take Responsibility for Our Own Success ✨

Just listened to the legendary Tony Gordon — expelled from school at 16.
Written off by teachers. Doubted by friends.
Today, at 79, he stands as one of the greatest icons in the insurance world.
A true GOAT.

He ended his sharing with this powerful truth:

“Take responsibility for our own success.
If things aren’t going our way…
Is it the company’s fault? Our manager’s fault? Other people’s fault?
NO… HELL NO!”

That hit deep.

My biggest takeaway?
We’re not stuck.
We’re not stone.
We can move.
We can change.
We can find solutions.

“We are not a stone. We can move.”

So let’s:
➡️ Stop blaming
➡️ Stop pointing fingers
➡️ Keep moving
➡️ Keep failing forward
➡️ Keep growing
➡️ Keep becoming better

Every get-up brings us higher.
Let’s keep climbing — together.

Sharing the stage with some of the industry’s Titans was surreal. It pushed me to reflect, refine, and recommit to growing my own systems even more before the next round.

I went in with the mindset of a sponge—ready to soak it all in. And I have to say, if you’re looking to stretch yourself and level up, take the stage. It changes you.

After NS, I stepped into Insurance straight. I heard it's sales and I can earn a lot of money, so why not? 🤷🏻‍♂️

But I had my struggles in the initial 8 months. I was only earning $1.8k in total. I almost gave up (I was in debt during that time as well).

Looking back, I’m glad I didn't give up. I feel that credit for my career breakthrough goes to both “perseverance” and “luck”. Breakthrough is something you have to be ready for, and when the element of luck comes, you break through. Breakthrough doesn’t come “just like that” because you learn and worked hard. 

Since then, warm cases started to come in and I earned my first $10k. Subsequently, sales were good and I even got married soon after 😄

So if you're having a tough start or hesitating because you're afraid of the hurdles, remember this: perseverance and readiness can turn even the smallest opportunity into a breakthrough. Keep pushing forward and your moment will come just like mine did!

So, you're a young adult, right? 

It's great to be young and carefree, but as you start to take on more responsibilities and make your way in the world, some areas that we usually overlook is our physical and financial health. 

While I’m not a health coach or fitness trainer that can provide you the expertise…

I can help with the insurance portion ;P
 
It's not the most exciting topic… but something you really can't afford to ignore. 

So, if you're ready to learn more about why insurance is important for young adults like you, dive into this post and explore the benefits of getting covered when you're young.

✅Cheaper Premiums When Younger
Did you know that you can lock in your premiums at cheaper prices? 

Life insurance premiums are based on several factors, including a person's health and age. Generally, the amount you pay to purchase a life insurance policy rises as you age. 

Rates can jump considerably if you wait until you are in your mid-thirties or forties due to the higher probability that the insurer will have to make a pay out on the policy you purchased. 

✅Guarantee your Insurability 
Many people think they can buy insurance with money….

Sorry to burst your bubble but unfortunately that isn't the case. 

You buy insurance primarily with your health. 

Almost ALL insurance policies have exemptions for pre-existing conditions, which means if you have a medical 
issue now, and buy insurance later, you won't be covered for that condition. 

The inevitable fact is that our health deteriorates as we age. Buying insurance when you're young and healthy lessens the need for medical check ups or more underwriting. We hope to be healthy forever but what if you and I are both wrong? Will it be too late?

✅Financial security in your Prime years ensures that you can focus on recuperating, even if it takes several years, without having to worry about paying for basic needs or family responsibilities.

And after almost 5 years in the industry, I can safely say, you will never be able to put a put a price tag on peace of mind"

In the fast-paced world of sales, success does not come by chance. It comes by design. And one of the most powerful tools a salesperson can have is a system.

When we talk about systems in sales, we are referring to a structured approach. A repeatable, reliable process that guides how we find leads, nurture relationships, present solutions and close deals. It is about turning daily chaos into a well-oiled machine.

Why does this matter?

Because systems drive productivity. They save time, reduce stress and eliminate guesswork. They help us prioritize the right clients, follow up at the right time and track the right metrics. With systems in place, we do not just work harder. We work smarter.

Imagine knowing exactly what your next step is with every prospect. Imagine having automated follow-ups that go out like clockwork. Imagine being able to train new team members with ease because everything is already mapped out.

That is the power of systems
They bring consistency
They create scalability
And most importantly, they deliver results

Sales is not just an art. It is a science. And systems are what turn potential into performance.

If you are in sales and want to rise above the noise, build your systems"
