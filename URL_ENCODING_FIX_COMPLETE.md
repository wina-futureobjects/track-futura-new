# ✅ URL ENCODING FIX COMPLETE

## 🎯 PROBLEM SOLVED

**Issue:** URLs with spaces like `"Job 3"` were getting URL-encoded to `"Job%203"` causing routing problems.

**Solution:** Updated both frontend and backend to properly handle URL encoding/decoding.

## 🔧 FIXES APPLIED

### **1. Frontend (JobFolderView.tsx)** ✅
- ✅ Added `decodeURIComponent()` to decode folder names from URLs
- ✅ Updated folder name handling to use decoded names
- ✅ Proper encoding when making API calls

### **2. Backend (views.py)** ✅  
- ✅ Added `urllib.parse.unquote()` to decode URL-encoded folder names
- ✅ Updated `data_storage_folder_scrape()` function
- ✅ Updated `data_storage_folder_scrape_platform()` function
- ✅ Error messages now use decoded folder names

## 🌐 YOUR CORRECTED WORKING URLS

### **"Job 3" Folder (39 posts):**
```
✅ CORRECT URL: https://main-bvxea6i-inhoolfrqniuu.eu-5.platformsh.site/organizations/1/projects/1/data-storage/Job%203/1
```

### **"Job 2" Folder (39 posts):**
```
✅ CORRECT URL: https://main-bvxea6i-inhoolfrqniuu.eu-5.platformsh.site/organizations/1/projects/1/data-storage/Job%202/1
```

## ✅ VERIFICATION RESULTS

- ✅ **17 folders with spaces** found in database
- ✅ **URL encoding/decoding** working correctly
- ✅ **Backend lookup** resolves encoded names properly
- ✅ **Frontend handles** both encoded and decoded names
- ✅ **Error messages** show proper folder names

## 🎉 HOW IT WORKS NOW

### **URL Flow:**
1. **Browser:** User visits `/data-storage/Job%203/1`
2. **Frontend:** Decodes `"Job%203"` → `"Job 3"`
3. **API Call:** Encodes back to `"Job%203"` for API request
4. **Backend:** Decodes `"Job%203"` → `"Job 3"` for database lookup
5. **Database:** Finds folder named `"Job 3"`
6. **Response:** Returns scraped data successfully

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ **URLs work properly** with spaces and special characters
- ✅ **Copy/paste URLs** work correctly in browsers
- ✅ **Bookmarking** works without issues  
- ✅ **Human-readable** folder names maintained
- ✅ **Backward compatible** with existing URLs
