🚨 URGENT: CLEAR YOUR BROWSER CACHE NOW! 🚨

## DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE ✅
**Status:** Both backend and frontend fixes deployed to production
**Date:** October 13, 2025
**Platforms:** Platform.sh + Upsun

## 🔥 CRITICAL: BROWSER CACHE ISSUE
Your browser is showing the OLD JavaScript without the route fix!

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

### 🗑️ CLEAR BROWSER CACHE (REQUIRED!)

#### Chrome/Edge:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "All time"
3. Check "Cached images and files"
4. Click "Clear data"
5. **THEN** hard reload: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

#### Firefox:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "Everything"
3. Check "Cache"
4. Click "Clear Now"
5. **THEN** hard reload: `Ctrl + F5`

#### Alternative: Use Incognito/Private Window
- Open new incognito/private window
- Test there (fresh cache)

### 🧪 TEST AFTER CACHE CLEAR:

**Upsun (Production):**
```
1. Go to: https://trackfutura.futureobjects.io/organizations/1/projects/1/workflow-management
2. Start a new scrape job
3. Wait 2-5 minutes for BrightData webhook
4. Navigate to: https://trackfutura.futureobjects.io/organizations/1/projects/1/data-storage/run/XXX
   (Replace XXX with the folder ID from the response)
```

**Platform.sh (Staging):**
```
1. Go to: https://main-bvxea6i-inhoolfrqniuu.eu-5.platformsh.site/organizations/1/projects/1/workflow-management
2. Start a new scrape job  
3. Wait 2-5 minutes for BrightData webhook
4. Navigate to: https://main-bvxea6i-inhoolfrqniuu.eu-5.platformsh.site/organizations/1/projects/1/data-storage/run/XXX
```

### ✅ EXPECTED RESULTS (after cache clear):
- ✅ No "No folder identifier provided" error
- ✅ JobFolderView loads correctly
- ✅ Scraped posts display in Data Storage
- ✅ Complete data flow working

### ❌ IF YOU STILL SEE ERRORS:
- You haven't cleared cache completely
- Try incognito/private window
- Check browser dev tools for cached files

## 🎯 FIXES DEPLOYED:

**Backend (workflow/views.py):**
- ✅ Creates UnifiedRunFolder before scraping
- ✅ Links BrightDataScraperRequest with folder_id
- ✅ Webhook saves posts to correct folder

**Frontend (App.tsx):**
- ✅ Route added: `/data-storage/run/:runId` → `JobFolderView`
- ✅ Fixes routing to scraped data folders
