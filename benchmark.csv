When I was in my teenage years, I used to think that by 30, I’d have life all figured out. I imagined having everything “perfectly”in place — be it my career, relationships, direction, confidence, I looked at adults around me thinking that once I grow up, I would have it all together. 

But as I age, I realise life isn’t about having it all figured out. 

It’s about embracing the unknown, growing through the seasons, and learning to be okay with not having all the answers.

For a long time, I’ve felt like I was behind — like I was lagging in the game of life while everyone else seemed to be moving faster, achieving more, checking off all the boxes. 

But over time, I’ve come to understand that we’re all running our own race. There’s no set timeline, no “right” pace. Just progress, presence, and purpose.

Looking back, I’m so grateful for the journey — the highs, the lows, the moments that broke me, and the ones that built me. I wouldn’t be who I am today without every twist and turn along the way.

And most importantly, I’m deeply thankful for the people who’ve been part of this ride — the ones who stayed, the ones who left, the ones who taught me lessons and the ones who continue to love and support me as I grow.

Here’s to entering this new decade with an open heart, steady faith, and a lot more grace. I’m excited for what’s ahead.

I may not have it all figured out, but I’m learning to trust the process — and that’s enough. 

花若盛開，蝴蝶自來；人若精彩，天自安排 ✨"

“Obedient,” “clever,” “average,” “a failure”…

seeking validation under the weight of expectations.

But deep inside, we’ve always been resisting.
The desire to truly be ourselves never disappeared — just buried under layers of life.

One day, we begin to see clearly:
these labels were never who we really were.
We can choose to peel them off,
and become who we were meant to be.

True freedom isn’t reckless.
It’s choosing with awareness, growing with discipline,
and living by values we define for ourselves.

That is strength — and a higher kind of freedom."

16 Years in the Business | 17 April 2025

I was just 21 when I RNF’d - wide-eyed, full of hope, with a simple dream: To make a real difference in people’s lives, especially the ones I loved.

I still remember what my leader’s mentor told me back then:
“If you do this right, with sincerity and service, you’ll never run out of people to help.”

Back then, I had no idea how deeply this journey would shape me. I just knew I wanted to be someone others could count on.

Fast forward 16 years…
440 clients. Countless moments of courage, care, and conversation.

Still here.
Still growing.
Still giving from the heart.

Grateful for every person who’s been part of this story -
Clients who became friends, friends who became clients, mentors who saw more in me than I saw in myself and my tribe who’ve stood by me through every season.

Here’s to the journey ahead.
The best is yet to come.

✨ Take Responsibility for Our Own Success ✨

Just listened to the legendary Tony Gordon — expelled from school at 16.
Written off by teachers. Doubted by friends.
Today, at 79, he stands as one of the greatest icons in the insurance world.
A true GOAT.

He ended his sharing with this powerful truth:

“Take responsibility for our own success.
If things aren’t going our way…
Is it the company’s fault? Our manager’s fault? Other people’s fault?
NO… HELL NO!”

That hit deep.

My biggest takeaway?
We’re not stuck.
We’re not stone.
We can move.
We can change.
We can find solutions.

“We are not a stone. We can move.”

So let’s:
➡️ Stop blaming
➡️ Stop pointing fingers
➡️ Keep moving
➡️ Keep failing forward
➡️ Keep growing
➡️ Keep becoming better

Every get-up brings us higher.
Let’s keep climbing — together.

A very good reminder to self. - Part 1"

Disclaimer: not trying to be disrespectful to anyone. Pardon the AI effect. 

“Sir, I just want to shake your hand.”
(He gave me a weird stare… and a gentle smack on the arm.)

After listening to the legendary Tony Gordon—the GOAT of the insurance industry—share his story, I was deeply inspired.

At 79, he flew from the US to Malaysia just to spend an hour with us. He could’ve stayed in the comfort of home, or travelled with friends. But he chose to be here—to give, to serve, to lift others. That alone taught me something: greatness doesn’t retire.

After his session, everyone rushed to take photos. I couldn’t get close, so I cheekily “photo bombed” and AI-ed myself closer in Photo 1.

But eventually, as the room cleared, we got a proper photo with him.

Then came my moment.
I walked up, extended my hand, and said:
“Sir, I just want to shake your hand.”

He looked at me with a confused stare… then gave me a light smack on the arm.

I wasn’t trying to be cheeky or disrespectful.
I just wanted to feel the warmth of his hand.
To remind myself—he’s human. Just like us.
Same warmth. Same heart. Same opportunity to do something great with our lives.

I’m grateful for this journey.
Grateful for the team and family we’ve built at PFG.
And grateful even for the tough days—because they’re shaping us for something greater.

Let’s keep going.
Because if he can, we can.
If he did, so can we.

Now I find myself asking, “𝙒𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙄 𝙙𝙤 𝙩𝙤 𝙢𝙖𝙠𝙚 𝙝𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙖𝙮 𝙨𝙥𝙚𝙘𝙞𝙖𝙡 𝙩𝙤𝙤?” Because love isn’t just about feeling—it’s about giving.

It was not a romantic night out, it was a night out to bring the boys for a walk trying to put them at a more relaxed environment to cope with what the family is going through. 

It hasn't been easy months especially for Godwin @godwinsohkw . The 3 weeks watching his mother withered away. The boys has been courageous to see her and pray for her. Is heartwarming to receive a dear friend voice recording of prayers for our family. Thank you for those who prayed for us for strength & peace. Another dear friend prayed for our boys not to be traumatised by this episode of scene, thank you for this prayer. As a mother, I have overlooked in this area. 

Thank you, Lord for sending all these angels to us.

John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 

Watched Passion of the Christ yesterday and reflected on it: 

I saw an image of myself in Judas - There were times where I turn myself away from him just because things didn’t go my way. But despite all these, he waited for me patiently to go back into his arms. 

When Jesus was carrying the cross and fall, Mary ran towards him - It showed me how Jesus was there for me when I fall, being with me throughout. 

When the Romans was hitting him until he was covered in blood, with his flesh and ribs visible. He could have used his power to not go through all these, but he knows he has to fufil his purpose that by his stripes, we are healed. 

Even when Jesus was on the cross, he still show grace and told god to forgive them, for they don’t know what they don’t know. I thought to myself: “Who am I to not forgive and show grace to others for god choose to forgive us even though we are sinners.”"

In the weeks leading up to it, I was anxious—not just because it was unfamiliar territory, but because I wanted every word to land with clarity and impact. I wanted to give the audience something truly valuable. Thank you @thianjong for the opportunity to step up and speak.

Sharing the stage with some of the industry’s Titans was surreal. It pushed me to reflect, refine, and recommit to growing my own systems even more before the next round.

I went in with the mindset of a sponge—ready to soak it all in. And I have to say, if you’re looking to stretch yourself and level up, take the stage. It changes you.

And of course, shoutout to my amazing team who showed up to support (even though I told the rest to stay back and hustle)— @g_hadens @amplifyingyourxindollar @zhiyu_520 @xlitude.sg , I see you and I appreciate you.

So, you're a young adult, right? 

It's great to be young and carefree, but as you start to take on more responsibilities and make your way in the world, some areas that we usually overlook is our physical and financial health. 

While I’m not a health coach or fitness trainer that can provide you the expertise…

I can help with the insurance portion ;P
 
It's not the most exciting topic… but something you really can't afford to ignore. 

So, if you're ready to learn more about why insurance is important for young adults like you, dive into this post and explore the benefits of getting covered when you're young.

✅Cheaper Premiums When Younger
Did you know that you can lock in your premiums at cheaper prices? 

Life insurance premiums are based on several factors, including a person's health and age. Generally, the amount you pay to purchase a life insurance policy rises as you age. 

Rates can jump considerably if you wait until you are in your mid-thirties or forties due to the higher probability that the insurer will have to make a pay out on the policy you purchased. 

✅Guarantee your Insurability 
Many people think they can buy insurance with money….

Sorry to burst your bubble but unfortunately that isn't the case. 

You buy insurance primarily with your health. 

Almost ALL insurance policies have exemptions for pre-existing conditions, which means if you have a medical 
issue now, and buy insurance later, you won't be covered for that condition. 

The inevitable fact is that our health deteriorates as we age. Buying insurance when you're young and healthy lessens the need for medical check ups or more underwriting. We hope to be healthy forever but what if you and I are both wrong? Will it be too late?

✅Financial security in your Prime years ensures that you can focus on recuperating, even if it takes several years, without having to worry about paying for basic needs or family responsibilities.

And after almost 5 years in the industry, I can safely say, you will never be able to put a put a price tag on peace of mind"

We even tried out Muay Thai and learned to cook four classic Thai dishes in a fun, hands-on cooking class.

2. Tried out their business class high speed rail (Shanghai ➡️ 昆山) for $15. 

3-5. Some crew moments while touring the water areas. Even tipping is at another level. 扫一扫二维码就行了.

An LPA is a legal document that lets you appoint someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you lose mental capacity one day — whether it’s about your health, finances, or property.

Back on 12 April 2025, PLG & @Advisory.Titans hosted an exclusive LPA awareness event to help more families plan ahead with peace of mind.

Shoutout to @iwanna_puay @binwei_ and @jefflowjy for making event a success!!! 😆

🎥 Here’s a quick look at how it went — and good news, we’re hosting another session real soon!

📩 Reach out to your Financial Advisor to reserve a slot or learn more about how to make your LPA today.

I did.

I am not that fortunate to have my mum or dad to buy for me, i dont think they even know what insurance can do.

Today, I have a new perspective on being an insurance agent (in case those who don’t know what I am doing still) 

It is because I learned to buy this protection, called “insurance,” for myself in my younger days. I know I have done some form of risk transfer, and I like to help some (not all, as I cannot save everyone) to have what I have. 

As I start to prep for this thing call “retirement”, I want to also start helping other to do the same.

I married my best friend and even so, it has been hella hard. Whoever that said marriage = happily ever after was clearly lying. Over the 8 years i learn that staying together is only possible if we keep choosing each other and not give up even when time gets hard. 

Not gonna be cringey and say like everything has been lovely and sweet. Cause it's not. But i'm gonna say i'm very proud of us for always walking out of each crisis stronger. & i hope we will never give up on each other 👊🏼 Happy Birthday to my manchild. The boy who never grows up. But at least you're a fun dad to our Atty boy ❤️ Thank you for honouring your role as a dad to the best of your abilities!"

A little bit of my journey leading up to that moment.

After NS, I stepped into Insurance straight. I heard it's sales and I can earn a lot of money, so why not? 🤷🏻‍♂️

But I had my struggles in the initial 8 months. I was only earning $1.8k in total. I almost gave up (I was in debt during that time as well).

Looking back, I’m glad I didn't give up. I feel that credit for my career breakthrough goes to both “perseverance” and “luck”. Breakthrough is something you have to be ready for, and when the element of luck comes, you break through. Breakthrough doesn’t come “just like that” because you learn and worked hard. 

Since then, warm cases started to come in and I earned my first $10k. Subsequently, sales were good and I even got married soon after 😄

So if you're having a tough start or hesitating because you're afraid of the hurdles, remember this: perseverance and readiness can turn even the smallest opportunity into a breakthrough. Keep pushing forward and your moment will come just like mine did!

An LPA is a legal document that lets you appoint someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you lose mental capacity one day — whether it’s about your health, finances, or property.

Back on 12 April 2025, PLG & @Advisory.Titans hosted an exclusive LPA awareness event to help more families plan ahead with peace of mind.

Shoutout to @iwanna_puay @binwei_ and @jefflowjy for making event a success!!! 😆

🎥 Here’s a quick look at how it went — and good news, we’re hosting another session real soon!

📩 Reach out to your Financial Advisor to reserve a slot or learn more about how to make your LPA today.

Met this young Indian lady recently—she’s got a degree in Computer Science but is feeling stuck at a crossroad, unsure of her next step. From a total stranger, I had the chance to journey with her using the Enneagram and coaching card. It opened her eyes to the areas she can grow in, and gave her a clearer sense of direction.

Honestly, it filled me with so much joy! Even though I’m not from her industry, I’m thankful I could contribute by helping her build clarity, confidence, and values to guide her decisions.

Also want to give a shoutout to my coach @lilianong73 who’s been such a strong support in my own growth. Through her 5-day challenge, I gained fresh perspective, strategy and direction in my recruitment efforts. She truly complements my weaknesses and gives me the push I need.

We even got to celebrate our birthdays together—and as her coachee, I had the privilege of using the coaching card @jensensiaw to bless her back with clarity and purpose in her current season.

So grateful for these divine appointments. Life is meaningful when we can pour what we’ve learned into others.

I began to see hope in every challenging moment —
and I find joy in sharing that hope with others.

I pray that this same gift and hope will be yours too.

也乐于将这份盼望分享给他人。

	1. I didn’t want to spend the best 40 years of my life stuck in a 9-to-5 corporate role 👨🏻‍💼
	2. I wanted to work with people, not for people 🤝

That’s why in 2021, I took a leap of faith into the financial advisory world ✨
Fast forward 4 years, and I’m proud of the growth, the lessons, and the milestones along the way 🛤️

In the last 3 years, I’ve had the freedom to spend 50–60 days overseas each year ✈️
—all while building a fulfilling career I genuinely enjoy 💼

2023: Vietnam, Zurich, Italy, Japan
2024: London, France, Vancouver 
2025: Japan, Vienna, New York, Miami 

Was it scary at the start? Definitely 😅
Was there uncertainty about the future? Everyday.
Was it worth it? Every single bit ✅

I wouldn’t be here without the support of my family, friends, mentors, and clients ❤️
Thank you for being part of the journey.

We’re all just getting started.
And if any part of this feels familiar to you… maybe it’s your turn. 🚀"

This year, I made a spontaneous decision by booking a solo trip to Bali for my birthday. Behind the spontaneity was a quiet need for something more - more clarity, more courage, more connection with myself. The thought of being alone in an unfamiliar place can be intimidating. But there’s no one to distract me, from me. And in that silence, I started to listen. I listened more—to the world around me and to myself. I noticed the little things: the art that spoke to me, dogs chasing waves, the sound of the ocean crashing onto shore. I confronted thoughts and feelings I usually drowned out with busyness. I learnt to appreciate my own pace, my own rhythm. I celebrated myself for the first time and celebrated with strangers who I may never meet again.

This picture hits hard.
Sometimes, we think we know everything.
We walk into rooms with confidence...
But life has a way of humbling us.

What I’ve learned from the industry:
 ➡️ Years won’t matter.
 ➡️ You’ll always have room for growth.
 ➡️ You’ll always learn from every season.

In these moments, we’re reminded:
 → We don’t have all the answers.
 → We’re not always right.
 → And that’s okay.

Success isn’t defined by how long you’ve been in the game—it’s defined by your willingness to keep evolving.

The most successful people I know aren’t the ones who stop at “𝙠𝙣𝙤𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙚𝙣𝙤𝙪𝙜𝙝”—they’re the ones who stay humble, stay open, and keep learning.

Even with 20 years of experience, there’s always room to grow. 

Every season brings new lessons, new challenges, and new opportunities to improve.

Stay hungry. Stay humble. Stay teachable.

 Life will keep teaching—if you're willing to keep learning.

Started the morning with a collective run — syncing heartbeats before strategy.

Then came our version of The Amazing Race — putting our skills to the test: from street approaches to HNW simulations, product drills to diving deep into the ACC heritage.

Afternoon - All about sharpening the sword: objection handling, real talk, real practice. 

Wrapped it up with a bold commitment — kicking off the Iron Mind 100-day challenge.
