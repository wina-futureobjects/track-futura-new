2. **Real Data Sources**: Connect to actual social media data
3. **Processing Logic**: Implement real sentiment analysis algorithms
4. **Database**: Store templates and generated reports
5. **Authentication**: Add user authentication and authorization
6. **File Uploads**: Add data upload functionality

### Current Demo Limitations:
- Uses mock data instead of real social media content
- Simulated processing time (2 seconds vs real processing)
- Limited to predefined sample reports
- No real user authentication
- No data persistence

## Perfect for:
- üéØ **Demonstrating UI/UX** to stakeholders
- üìù **Gathering feedback** on design and workflow
