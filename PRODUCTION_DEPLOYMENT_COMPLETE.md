## üìã NEXT STEPS (Manual Configuration Required)

### 1. BrightData Dashboard Configuration
You need to configure the webhook URL in your BrightData dashboard:
- **Webhook URL**: `https://trackfutura.futureobjects.io/api/brightdata-webhook/`
- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: application/json

### 2. Database Migration (Optional Enhancement)
The `webhook_delivered` field is in the code but may need manual database update:
```sql
-- Run this in your production database if needed:
ALTER TABLE brightdata_integration_brightdatascrapedpost 
ADD COLUMN webhook_delivered BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```
