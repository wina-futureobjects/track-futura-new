- Create UnifiedRunFolder with proper folder_type and platform_code
- Create BrightDataScraperRequest with folder_id for each URL
- Link webhook results to folder via folder_id
- Add cleanup on error (delete folder if scrape fails)
- Return folder_id and data_storage_url in response

This fixes the issue where scraped data from BrightData
was not appearing in the Data Storage page because no
UnifiedRunFolder was created to store the results."
