next, what I need you to do is

to check the webhook and notification implementation in this application, to make sure that the webhook is working correctly when calling the brightdata APi when deploying the apps in Upsun, if needed, you can use ngrok to run it locally first, to test the functionality, just make sure that when i deploy to upsun, it should works without issue

first you should understand the project by reading the related code,

please do search online if necesssary to find out the best UI design principle
and software architecture.

please make sure the development of the code is at professional level, this is for the use of big tech company like Apple.
