# Data Storage System Restructure Plan

## Project Overview
Transform the data storage system to create a unified, automated workflow for social media data collection and management across multiple platforms (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok).

## Current Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED PHASES 1-3

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Universal Data Display Template
**Status: COMPLETED**

- Implemented cross-platform data display functionality
- Added CSV upload feature for testing purposes
- Fixed data fetching, sorting, filtering, and pagination issues
- Resolved page flashing/scroll reset issues with proper `useEffect` and `useCallback` usage

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Data Storage Page Transformation
**Status: COMPLETED**
- Transformed `DataStorage.tsx` from tabbed interface to unified folder list
- Implemented table-based UI following `ProjectsList.tsx` design pattern
- Added folder creation, editing, and deletion functionality
- Integrated platform-specific icons and colors
- Added search and filtering capabilities
- Implemented proper error handling and user feedback
- **UPDATED**: Removed platform-specific folder routes and navigation
- **UPDATED**: All data upload pages now redirect to unified Data Storage
- **UPDATED**: Sidebar simplified to single "Data Storage" menu item

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Folder Management System
**Status: COMPLETED**
- Created folder creation dialog with platform and category selection
- Implemented folder editing functionality
- Added folder deletion with confirmation
- Integrated with backend API endpoints for all platforms
- Added proper validation and error handling
- Implemented real-time folder list updates

### ‚úÖ Phase 3.5: Universal Data System Implementation
**Status: COMPLETED**
- **REPLACED**: All platform-specific data upload pages with single `UniversalDataPage.tsx`
- **CREATED**: Dynamic routing system using `/data/:platform/:folderId` pattern
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Platform-specific data adapters for seamless data transformation
- **ENABLED**: Future platform scalability - adding new platforms only requires new adapter functions
- **MAINTAINED**: All existing functionality while reducing code duplication
- **DELETED**: `InstagramDataUpload.tsx`, `FacebookDataUpload.tsx`, `LinkedInDataUpload.tsx`, `TikTokDataUpload.tsx`
