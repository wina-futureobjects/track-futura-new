# AI Analysis Chatbot Integration - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

The AI Analysis Chatbot at `http://localhost:5173/organizations/5/projects/6/analysis` is now fully integrated with your backend data and can differentiate between company and competitor data.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Data Integration Service Enhanced

**File**: `backend/common/data_integration_service.py`

**New Features**:
- ✅ Added `_get_source_folder_mapping()` - Maps sources to folder types (company/competitor)
- ✅ Updated `get_all_posts()` - Now includes `source_type` and `source_folder` for each post
- ✅ Added `get_company_posts()` - Fetches only company data
- ✅ Added `get_competitor_posts()` - Fetches only competitor data
- ✅ Updated `get_engagement_metrics()` - Can filter by source_type
- ✅ Supports all platforms: Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok

**How It Works**:
1. Reads your TrackSource data and matches posts to sources
2. Checks each source's folder to determine if it's "company" or "competitor"
3. Tags each post with `source_type` and `source_folder` metadata
4. Allows filtering data by company vs competitor

### 2. AI Chatbot Prompt Enhanced

**File**: `backend/chat/openai_service.py`

**New Context Provided to AI**:
```
=== COMPANY DATA ===
Company Posts: X posts
Company Engagement Metrics:
- Total Posts, Likes, Comments, Shares, Views
- Avg Engagement Rate
- Platform Breakdown

=== COMPETITOR DATA ===
Competitor Posts: Y posts
Competitor Engagement Metrics:
- Total Posts, Likes, Comments, Shares, Views
- Avg Engagement Rate
- Platform Breakdown

=== OVERALL COMPARISON ===
Total Posts, Engagement Rates, etc.
```

**AI Capabilities Updated**:
1. Social Media Analytics
2. **Competitive Analysis** ← NEW!
3. Sentiment Analysis
4. Content Strategy
5. Trend Analysis
6. Platform Optimization

## Test Results

**Project ID**: 6

**Found Data**:
- ✅ **Competitor Posts**: 5 posts from Adidas (Instagram)
  - Source Type: `competitor`
  - Source Folder: `Competitor`
  - Has engagement metrics (likes, comments, etc.)

**Data Structure**:
Each post now includes:
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "platform": "instagram",
  "content": "Post content...",
  "user": "adidas",
  "likes": 3649,
  "comments": 10,
  "source_type": "competitor",  ← NEW!
  "source_folder": "Competitor",  ← NEW!
  ...
}
```

## How to Use

### 1. Ensure You Have Company and Competitor Sources

Make sure your sources are assigned to folders:

- **Company Folder** (`folder_type: 'company'`):
  - Your brand's social media accounts
  - Example: Nike, Brand Sources, etc.

- **Competitor Folder** (`folder_type: 'competitor'`):
  - Competitor social media accounts
  - Example: Adidas, Competitor, etc.

### 2. Ask the Chatbot Questions

The AI can now answer questions like:

**Competitive Analysis**:
- "How is our engagement compared to competitors?"
- "What are competitors posting about?"
- "Compare my company's likes vs competitors"
- "Show competitor vs company performance"

**Company-Specific**:
- "What's our engagement rate?"
- "How are our posts performing?"
- "What content gets the most likes for us?"

**Competitor-Specific**:
- "What are competitors doing well?"
- "Show competitor engagement trends"
- "What content types do competitors use?"

### 3. The AI Will Provide

- ✅ **Separated metrics** for company vs competitors
- ✅ **Comparative analysis** (e.g., "Your engagement is 2.5% vs competitors' 4.2%")
- ✅ **Specific insights** based on real data
- ✅ **Actionable recommendations** to improve performance
- ✅ **Platform-specific breakdowns**

## Example Chatbot Response

**User**: "Compare my engagement with competitors"

**AI**: "Based on the last 7 days of data:

**YOUR COMPANY**:
- 0 posts
- Engagement Rate: N/A

**COMPETITORS** (Adidas):
- 5 posts on Instagram
- Average Engagement Rate: 4.2%
- Total Likes: 18,245
- Total Comments: 50

**RECOMMENDATION**: Your competitors are actively posting and seeing good engagement. Consider increasing your posting frequency to at least 2-3 posts per week to build audience engagement."

## Data Flow

```
1. User Asks Question
   ↓
2. Frontend sends to /api/chat/threads/{id}/add_message/
   ↓
3. Backend fetches project_id data:
   - Company posts & metrics
   - Competitor posts & metrics
   ↓
4. Sends to OpenAI with context
   ↓
5. AI generates response with:
   - Real metrics
   - Comparative insights
   - Specific recommendations
   ↓
6. Response sent back to user
```

## What the AI Knows

The AI has access to:
- ✅ All posts from last 7 days (company + competitor)
- ✅ Engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares, views)
- ✅ Platform breakdown (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok)
- ✅ Source folder classification (company vs competitor)
- ✅ Content analysis (hashtags, descriptions)
- ✅ Sentiment analysis results
- ✅ Trend data

## Important Notes

1. **Data Freshness**: The chatbot uses data from the last 7 days by default
2. **Source Folders Required**: Sources must be assigned to folders for proper classification
3. **OpenAI API Key**: Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in environment variables
4. **Project ID**: The frontend automatically passes `project_id=6` in the API call

## Troubleshooting

**If AI says "no data found"**:
1. Check that you have scraped data in Data Storage
2. Verify sources are assigned to folders (company/competitor)
3. Check that data is less than 7 days old
4. Try asking "What data do you have access to?"

**If AI doesn't differentiate company vs competitor**:
1. Verify source folders have correct `folder_type` (company/competitor)
2. Check source URLs match the post usernames
3. Review test results in `backend/test_chat_data.py`

## Next Steps

To add company data:
1. Add your company's social media sources to "Brand Sources" folder (with `folder_type: 'company'`)
2. Run scrapes for your company accounts
3. The chatbot will automatically include both company and competitor data

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `backend/common/data_integration_service.py`
2. ✅ `backend/chat/openai_service.py`

The chatbot is now ready to provide intelligent, data-driven insights with proper company vs competitor differentiation!
