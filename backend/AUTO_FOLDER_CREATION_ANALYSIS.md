# Auto Folder Creation Analysis for Track Futura

## üîç Current Status: ‚úÖ ENABLED BUT NOT WORKING PROPERLY

**Date:** January 2025  
**Auto Folder Creation:** ‚úÖ Enabled by default  
**Folder Creation:** ‚úÖ Working (folders are being created)  
**Data Population:** ‚ùå NOT WORKING (folders are empty)  
**Webhook Integration:** ‚ùå NOT WORKING (webhooks not reaching system)

---

## üìä Current System Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Auto Folder Creation is Enabled**
   - `auto_create_folders = True` by default in `BatchScraperJob` model
   - All recent batch jobs have `auto_create_folders=True`
   - Folders are being created automatically during job scheduling

2. **Folder Creation Logic**
   - `_get_or_create_output_folder()` method in `AutomatedBatchScraper` class
   - Creates platform-specific folders with naming pattern: `{Platform}_{ContentType}_{Date}_{JobName}`
   - Example: `Instagram_POSTS_2025-08-05_Batch Job - instagram - posts`

3. **Folder Assignment**
   - Scraper requests are correctly assigned folder IDs
   - Recent jobs show proper folder assignment:
     - Job 126 (Facebook): folder_id=7
     - Job 127 (Instagram): folder_id=9  
     - Job 128 (TikTok): folder_id=7

### ‚ùå What's Not Working

1. **Webhook Reception**
   - **Primary Issue**: BrightData cannot reach `localhost:8000`
   - Webhooks are not being delivered to Track Futura
   - Job statuses remain "pending" instead of updating to "completed"

2. **Data Population**
   - Folders are created but remain empty
   - No posts are being saved to the database
   - Webhook data processing is not happening

3. **Status Updates**
   - Scraper requests stuck in "pending" status
   - No status progression through the workflow

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Folder Creation Process

```python
# In brightdata_integration/services.py
def _get_or_create_output_folder(self, job: BatchScraperJob, platform: str, source: TrackSource, content_type: str):
    if not job.auto_create_folders:
        return None
    
    # Create folder name: Facebook_POSTS_2025-01-15_Batch Job Name
    folder_name = f"{platform.title()}_{content_type_for_name.upper()}_{timezone.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}_{job.name}"
    
    # Create or get folder
    folder, created = FolderModel.objects.get_or_create(
        name=folder_name,
        defaults={'project_id': job.project_id}
    )
    
    return folder.id
```

### Webhook Data Processing

```python
# In brightdata_integration/views.py
def _process_webhook_data_with_batch_support(data, platform: str, scraper_requests):
    # Get shared folder_id from first request
    shared_folder_id = scraper_requests[0].folder_id
    
    # Process each post and assign to shared folder
    for post_data in valid_posts:
        post_fields = _map_post_fields(post_data, platform)
        post_fields['folder'] = folder  # Assign to shared folder
        
        # Create post in database
        post, created = PostModel.objects.get_or_create(
            post_id=post_id,
            folder=folder,
            defaults=post_fields
        )
```

### Current Folder Status

| Job ID | Platform | Folder ID | Folder Name | Status | Posts Count |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| 126 | Facebook | 7 | xxx | pending | 0 |
| 127 | Instagram | 9 | Instagram_POSTS_2025-08-05_Batch Job - instagram - posts | pending | 0 |
| 128 | TikTok | 7 | xxx | pending | 0 |

## üö® Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Webhook URL Configuration

**Problem**: BrightData cannot reach `localhost:8000` from the internet
- Current webhook URL: `http://localhost:8000/api/brightdata/webhook/`
- BrightData servers cannot access localhost
- Webhooks are never delivered to Track Futura

**Impact**: 
- No webhook data processing
- No status updates
- No data population in folders
- Jobs remain in "pending" status

### Secondary Issue: Webhook Processing

**Problem**: Even if webhooks were received, there might be processing issues
- Webhook handler exists and is properly configured
- Data processing logic is implemented
- Folder assignment logic is working

## üîß Solution Implementation

### Step 1: Fix Webhook URL (CRITICAL)

The webhook URL must be accessible from the internet:

#### Option A: Use ngrok (Recommended for Development)
```bash
# Start ngrok
ngrok http 8000

# Set environment variable
set BRIGHTDATA_BASE_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io
```

#### Option B: Use Local Network IP
```bash
# Find your IP
ipconfig

# Set environment variable
set BRIGHTDATA_BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.100:8000
```

#### Option C: Deploy to Cloud
Deploy to a cloud service with a public URL.

### Step 2: Verify Webhook Reception

After fixing the webhook URL:

1. **Test webhook accessibility**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py test_webhook_setup
   ```

2. **Monitor webhook logs**:
   ```bash
   # Check Django logs for webhook reception
   tail -f logs/django.log | grep webhook
   ```

3. **Verify job status updates**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py shell -c "from brightdata_integration.models import ScraperRequest; print([f'{r.id}: {r.status}' for r in ScraperRequest.objects.all()[:5]])"
   ```

### Step 3: Verify Data Population

Once webhooks are working:

1. **Check folder contents**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py shell -c "from instagram_data.models import InstagramPost; print(f'Total posts: {InstagramPost.objects.count()}')"
   ```

2. **Monitor real-time updates**:
   - Watch the History tab in workflow management
   - Check folder contents in data storage
   - Verify job status progression

## üìã Verification Checklist

### ‚úÖ Auto Folder Creation
- [x] `auto_create_folders` is enabled by default
- [x] Folders are being created during job scheduling
- [x] Folder naming pattern is correct
- [x] Folder assignment to scraper requests is working

### ‚ùå Webhook Integration
- [ ] Webhook URL is accessible from internet
- [ ] BrightData can reach the webhook endpoint
- [ ] Webhook data is being received
- [ ] Job statuses are updating from "pending" to "completed"

### ‚ùå Data Population
- [ ] Webhook data is being processed
- [ ] Posts are being saved to database
- [ ] Folders are being populated with data
- [ ] Real-time updates are working

---

## üéØ Expected Results After Fix

Once the webhook URL is fixed:

1. **Webhook Reception**: BrightData webhooks will reach Track Futura
2. **Status Updates**: Job status will progress from "pending" ‚Üí "processing" ‚Üí "completed"
3. **Data Population**: Folders will be populated with scraped posts
4. **Real-time Updates**: History tab will show live status updates
5. **Data Storage**: Data storage will contain the scraped content

## üîÑ Workflow Summary

### Current Flow (Broken)
1. ‚úÖ Job created with `auto_create_folders=True`
2. ‚úÖ Folder created automatically
3. ‚úÖ Scraper request assigned to folder
4. ‚ùå Job sent to BrightData with localhost webhook URL
5. ‚ùå BrightData cannot reach webhook
6. ‚ùå No status updates or data population

### Fixed Flow (After Webhook URL Fix)
1. ‚úÖ Job created with `auto_create_folders=True`
2. ‚úÖ Folder created automatically
3. ‚úÖ Scraper request assigned to folder
4. ‚úÖ Job sent to BrightData with public webhook URL
5. ‚úÖ BrightData sends webhook when complete
6. ‚úÖ Status updates and data population occur

---

## üìû Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action**: Fix webhook URL using ngrok or public IP
2. **Verification**: Test webhook reception and data processing
3. **Monitoring**: Watch for real-time status updates and data population
4. **Documentation**: Update this analysis with working results

The auto folder creation system is **fully implemented and enabled**, but the webhook URL issue prevents it from working properly. Once the webhook URL is fixed, the entire system should work as expected.
