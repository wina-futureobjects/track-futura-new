# Final Folder Structure Fix Summary

## Issue Resolution Complete âœ…

The hierarchical folder structure has been successfully fixed and now works exactly as expected.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Project Isolation**
- **Problem**: TrackSource items were spread across multiple projects (9, 13, 14)
- **Solution**: Ensured each scraping run only uses TrackSource items from its own project
- **Result**: Project 14 now has exactly 12 TrackSource items (3 per platform Ã— 4 platforms)

### 2. **Service Type Cleanup**
- **Problem**: Project 9 had TrackSource items for reels and comments services
- **Solution**: Deleted non-posts TrackSource items from Project 9
- **Result**: All projects now only have "posts" service TrackSource items

### 3. **Duplicate Service Folders**
- **Problem**: Some runs had 2 service folders per platform instead of 1
- **Solution**: Identified and removed duplicate service folders
- **Result**: Each run now has exactly 1 service folder per platform

### 4. **Content Folder Consolidation**
- **Problem**: Content folders were split across duplicate service folders
- **Solution**: Moved all content folders to the single remaining service folder
- **Result**: All content folders are properly organized under their service folder

## Current Structure

### âœ… **Perfect Hierarchical Structure**
```
Scraping Run - [Date and time] (UnifiedRunFolder)
â”œâ”€â”€ Facebook - Posts (Service Folder)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Facebook Profile - testuser (Content Folder)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Facebook Profile - testuser2 (Content Folder)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Facebook Profile - testuser3 (Content Folder)
â”œâ”€â”€ Instagram - Posts (Service Folder)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Instagram Profile - testuser (Content Folder)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Instagram Profile - testuser2 (Content Folder)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Instagram Profile - testuser3 (Content Folder)
â”œâ”€â”€ LinkedIn - Posts (Service Folder)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LinkedIn Profile - in (Content Folder)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LinkedIn Profile - in2 (Content Folder)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ LinkedIn Profile - in3 (Content Folder)
â””â”€â”€ TikTok - Posts (Service Folder)
    â”œâ”€â”€ TikTok Profile - testuser (Content Folder)
    â”œâ”€â”€ TikTok Profile - testuser2 (Content Folder)
    â””â”€â”€ TikTok Profile - testuser3 (Content Folder)
```

### âœ… **Project-Specific Data**
- **Project 9**: 4 TrackSource items â†’ 1 service folder per platform with 1 content folder each
- **Project 13**: 8 TrackSource items â†’ 1 service folder per platform with 2 content folders each  
- **Project 14**: 12 TrackSource items â†’ 1 service folder per platform with 3 content folders each

### âœ… **Frontend Display**
- **7 parent folders** (UnifiedRunFolder entries) as expected
- **Each parent folder contains exactly 4 service folders** (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok)
- **Project 14 runs show 4 service folders with 3 content folders each** (12 total inputs)

## Automatic Folder Creation

The system now properly supports automatic folder creation:

1. **When a scraping run is scheduled**: Only TrackSource items from that project are used
2. **Service folders**: Exactly 1 per platform per run
3. **Content folders**: All TrackSource items for that platform are grouped under the service folder
4. **Webhook ready**: BrightData output will be stored in the appropriate content folders

## API Endpoints Working

- `/api/track-accounts/report-folders/` - Returns UnifiedRunFolder entries
- `/api/{platform}-data/folders/` - Returns platform-specific folders
- All endpoints properly filter by project and support hierarchical data

## Status: âœ… RESOLVED

The hierarchical folder structure is now:
- âœ… **Project-isolated**: Each run only uses its project's TrackSource items
- âœ… **Service-consistent**: Only "posts" service folders (no reels/comments)
- âœ… **Properly grouped**: 1 service folder per platform with multiple content folders
- âœ… **Frontend-ready**: Displays exactly as expected (7 parent folders, 4 service folders each)
- âœ… **Webhook-compatible**: Ready to receive and store BrightData output

**The folder structure is now fully functional and ready for production use!** ðŸš€
